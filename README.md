# Numerical Methods course

This moves some of the teaching matieral for UoS's MATH3018/6141 Numerical Methods course to the
[course framework](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) of
[Ines Montani](https://github.com/ines) developed and used for their
[spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io). The front-end is powered by
[Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the
back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org) ðŸ’–

See the
[course framework README](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) for
