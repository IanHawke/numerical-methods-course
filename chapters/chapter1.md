<exercise id="2" title="Getting Started">

What would you type in the terminal to compute \\(2.3^{4.5}\\)?

<choice id="ch1_q1">

<opt text="<code>pow(2.3, 4.5)</code>">

This would work in the C programming language, but not in Python.

</opt>
<opt text="<code>2.3^4.5</code>">

This would work in Matlab, but would give something very odd in Python.

</opt>
<opt text="<code>2.3**4.5</code>" correct="true">

This is correct: well done.

</opt>

</choice>

<exercise id="3" title="First steps">

This is a code exercise. The content can be formatted in simple Markdown – so
you can have **bold text**, `code` or [links](https://spacy.io) or lists, like
the one for the instructions below.

- These are instructions and they can have bullet points.
- The code block below will look for the files `exc_01_03`, `solution_01_03` and
  `test_01_03` in `/exercises`.

<codeblock id="01_03">

This is a hint.
